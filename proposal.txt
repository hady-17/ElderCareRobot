Dear Dr. Ahmad Hamoud,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to kindly request your approval for my senior project proposal titled “Elder Care Monitoring Rover with Voice Assistant.”

This project aims to develop an indoor robot that uses AI-powered facial recognition and a voice assistant to monitor an elderly person’s well-being, remind them about their medication schedule, and send alerts to family members via Discord or SMS if the user shows distress or does not respond. The system will run on a Raspberry Pi for offline operation, prioritizing privacy and reliability.

I believe this project aligns with our program’s objectives and addresses an important real-world need.

Could you please review and let me know if this idea is acceptable, or if you’d like me to adjust any aspect of the proposal?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
